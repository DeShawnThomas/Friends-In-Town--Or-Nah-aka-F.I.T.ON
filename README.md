# F.I.T.O.N-Friends-In-Town-Or-Nah
First Solo Project post Coding Dojo graduation

## Description 

Introducing F.I.T.O.N (Friends in Town, Or Nah) - a solo project I developed and showcased on GitHub. This Python-based app, built using the Flask framework, was designed to cater to individuals with newly formed friend groups, providing them with a seamless way to determine if their friends are available for plans.

As the sole developer of F.I.T.O.N, I took on the challenge of creating this project independently, without the guidance of a bootcamp this time. This allowed me to push myself and explore new technologies, particularly focusing on integrating AJAX and leveraging APIs.

Using intuitive user interfaces and advanced scheduling algorithms, F.I.T.O.N enables users to check if their new friends are in town and available for plans. By incorporating a geolocation API, the app offers a convenient way for users to determine the availability of their friends for potential hangouts.

To enhance the responsiveness and user experience, I leveraged AJAX technology, providing real-time updates and dynamic content. This feature ensures that users receive up-to-date information, facilitating a smooth and efficient planning process.

F.I.T.O.N represents my dedication to challenging myself as a developer and exploring new technologies. Through this project, I aimed to create a practical solution that combines my passion for software engineering with a focus on fostering new friendships and connections.

## Why did I make this app? 

I embarked on the development of F.I.T.O.N (Friends in Town, Or Nah) driven by personal experiences and a desire to address a common challenge. As someone who recently started making new friends, I encountered difficulties in keeping track of who was available or in town for social activities. This inspired me to create an app that would simplify the process and provide a user-friendly solution for individuals like myself. By developing F.I.T.O.N, I aimed to alleviate the frustration and ambiguity surrounding planning with friends, allowing users to effortlessly stay connected and make the most of their social interactions.
